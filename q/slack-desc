# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

q: q (line-orientated WYSIWYG editor with a powerful macro facility)
q:
q: Q is a command-line-driven, line-oriented editor. In Q, you are
q: always editing a line: either the next command or a line from the file
q: being edited. Either way, almost all control characters perform some
q: editing function. Q is big on minimising typing.
q: Q macros can be written to act like subroutines or even functions.
q: On starting freshly installed Q, you get a default macro set.
q: There's no need to learn a special language to write macros, just the
q: N-NEWMACRO command.

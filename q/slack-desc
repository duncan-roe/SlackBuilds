# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

q: Q is a command-line-driven, line-oriented editor with a powerful macro
q: facility. Q is always editing a line: either the next command or a
q: line from the file being edited. Either way, almost all control
q: characters perform some editing function. A rich set of pseudo-macros
q: enables macros to act like subroutines, perform tests and much more.
q: On starting freshly installed Q, you get a default macro set.
